# Multiverse

`Multiverse` is the next-generation data storage back-end for the widely used [Alembic](https://github.com/alembic/alembic) file format.

> Authors: Marco Pantaleoni, Aghiles Kheffache, Bo Zhou, Paolo Berto Durante.


The _"Multiverse"_ name is also used for the proprietary commercial product [Multiverse | Studio](http://multi-verse.io). `Multiverse | Studio` is a fast, efficient and easy to use solution for CGI/VFX studios, whose main purposes are to scale complexity in look-development, render procedurally, inter-op between DCC Apps like [Maya](https://autodesk.com/products/maya) and [Katana](https://foundry.com/products/katana). `Multiverse | Studio` offers full integration for the Multiverse back-end and as of June 2017 is distributed by [Foundry](https://foundry.com).

> NOTE: This repository is about the Multiverse _back-end_, not the end-user product Multiverse | Studio.


## Repository organization

The original upstream Alembic code resides in the [master](https://github.com/j-cube/multiverse/tree/master) branch.

In terms of version numbering, `Multiverse` stays in-sync with the Alembic releases: 

the `Multiverse` code for the `1.7.1` release, resides in its own [1.7.1/multiverse](https://github.com/j-cube/multiverse/tree/1.7.1/multiverse) branch and is the default landing branch for the repository when browsing on GitHub.

To use `Multiverse`, just checkout its branch:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/j-cube/multiverse.git
...

$ git checkout 1.7.1/multiverse
```


## Multiverse dependencies

In addition to the original Alembic dependencies, `Multiverse` needs the following additional dependencies:

* [libgit2 v0.23.4+](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/archive/v0.23.4.tar.gz)
* [msgpack 1.0.1+](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-c/releases/download/cpp-1.0.1/msgpack-1.0.1.tar.gz)
* [boost 1.48.0+](http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.48.0/boost_1_48_0.tar.bz2/download) compiled also with `chrono`, `filesystem`, `system` (in addition to the original `program_options`, `thread` and `python`)

### "Classic" Git and Milliways

`Multiverse` source contains [Milliways](https://github.com/j-cube/milliways) "The storage at the back-end of the Multiverse". Milliways is a high-performance on-disk tree-based key-value store, used in Multiverse as an optional pluggable back-end to `libgit2`. `Milliways` was created to improve performance over the "classic" Multiverse Git backend by introducing a single file store database. As of release 1.7.1 we default to Milliways and a single .abc file is created, making the Git repository non visible to the user. CLassic Git repository can always be created optionall. 


## Research

`Multiverse` and `Milliways` are research projects by J CUBE Inc. Multiverse was published at SIGGRAPH Asia 2015 in Kobe, Japan. More information on [J CUBE Research](http://j-cube.jp/research).
